        <h2>API</h2>
        <p>You can also directly use the API to generate a sitemap. To do this, append the URL of the website to the following base URL:</p>
        <code>https://getsitemap.funkpd.com/json?url=</code>
        <p>For example, to generate a sitemap for "https://funkpd.com", you would use the following URL:</p>
        <code>https://getsitemap.funkpd.com/json?url=https://funkpd.com</code>

        <h2 id="why-we-made-sitemapscanner-and-how-we-use-it-at-funkpd">Why We Made SitemapScanner and How We Use It at FunkPd</h2>
        <p>At FunkPd, we’re in the business of making your digital world run smoother than a freshly greased machine. We’ve been around the block and back, and we know one thing for sure: a website that doesn’t get crawled right is like a book that never gets read. Enter SitemapScanner, our knight in shining armor, ensuring every single page on your site gets the spotlight it deserves.</p>
        <h4 id="the-big-guns-screaming-frog-ahrefs-and-bing-webmaster-tools">The Big Guns: Screaming Frog, Ahrefs, and Bing Webmaster Tools</h4>
        <p>Let’s talk about the heavy hitters: Screaming Frog, Ahrefs, and Bing Webmaster Tools. These are the guys you call in when you want your site combed through with a fine-tooth comb. But here’s the kicker—they can only crawl what they can see. Without a complete list of URLs, they’re like bloodhounds with blindfolds. SitemapScanner changes the game. We feed these tools a full buffet of URLs, ensuring no page is left in the dark. It’s like handing them a map to hidden treasure—every page gets its moment in the sun, and your SEO efforts hit full throttle.</p>
        <p>Picture this: You’ve got a sprawling website, brimming with valuable content. But some of those gems are buried deep, lost in the shuffle. SitemapScanner digs them out, presenting them on a silver platter to our crawler tools. The result? A thorough audit, a clear roadmap, and an optimized site that performs like a dream.</p>
        <h4 id="fueling-our-custom-creations">Fueling Our Custom Creations</h4>
        <p>But we don’t just stop at SEO. SitemapScanner is the backbone of our custom applications. Take ScreenshotPro, our tool for capturing every nook and cranny of your site. With SitemapScanner, we get a full roster of URLs, ensuring no page goes un-photographed. This is crucial for quality checks, client presentations, and maintaining a visual history of your site. It’s like having a digital scrapbook that keeps track of every change, every tweak, every enhancement.</p>
        <p>And then there’s FPMonitor, our watchdog for site performance. FPMonitor needs to know every single URL to keep an eye on uptime and performance. SitemapScanner hands over the complete list, and FPMonitor gets to work, ensuring your site is always up, always fast, and always ready for your users. It’s peace of mind in a piece of code.</p>
